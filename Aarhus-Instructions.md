# Continuous Delivery Pipeline - The Project

This group project should take you through most of the steps for setting up a functional pipeline for your own project. In this project we have a very small product, a tiny webservice implemented in GO - converting integers to their Roman numeral representation.

When the day is over you should be able to make changes to your Roman numeral implementation and follow the build steps all the way to a new release.

We want to use all the tools and techniques we learned this week.  

    * Test driven development
    * Agile task management with github issues
    * Version control with git
    * Build, test and ship with docker containers
    * Continuous Delivery with Jenkins
    * Extra credit:
      * Implement the praqmatic git flow branching strategy

## Outline of the day

The project is done in groups, and we will pause you all every now and then to give some feedback during the day, and to enable you to share experiences. You will have all day to work with the project, and we do not have a definitive "DONE" criteria, so just take you time you need to understand the steps in the build pipeline.

The end goal for our development process:

 * A build and test environment with docker for developers
 * Have a jenkins server set up to automatically build `master` branches
 * Automatically delivering successful builds to the production environment
 * Configure the Jenkins jobs using JobDSL and Groovy
