## Fork go-roman

The starting point for the project is Go:[https://github.com/praqma-training/go-roman](https://github.com/praqma-training/go-roman).

   1. **Make your own fork**. Fork the project in github to make the shared repository for your team.

If you are in a team:

   1. Add your teammates as collaborators
   2. Enable github issues
   3. Create board at waffle.io

This will serve as the basis for your work, and should be up to date at all times.
