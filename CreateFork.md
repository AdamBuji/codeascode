The starting point for the project is Go:[https://github.com/praqma-training/gowebserver](https://github.com/praqma-training/gowebserver).

   1. **Make a fork for your team**. Fork the project in github to make the shared repository for your team. Add the teammates as collaborators
   2. Enable github issues
   3. Create board at waffle.io

This will serve as the basis for your work, and should be up to date at all times.
