## Step III - pretested
Implement a Pretested Integration workflow

Add [pre-tested integration](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pretested+Integration+Plugin) for your build.

Hint: Since Jenkins might have to do commits on merges, you will have to set up a `user.name` and `user.email` setting in Jenkins global configuration. ("jenkins" and "jenkins@localhost" should do fine for now).
