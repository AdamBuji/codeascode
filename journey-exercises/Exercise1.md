## Create your own fork for the gowebserver

Each team needs _one_ repo to be their central origin.
Make sure that everyone in the team is added as a collaborator connects to that particular server when setting things up.

Follow the instructions here [../CreateFork.md](../CreateFork.md)

When you have created the fork, add a link to your fork on this github issue:
https://github.com/praqma-training/gowebserver/issues/2
